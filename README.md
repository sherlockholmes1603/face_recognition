# face_recognition

I have attempted to perform a face recognition using triplet loss meothod

tiplet_loss.ipynub contains detecting and extracting the face of a given dataset using mtcnn, training and testing using normal model, training and testing using triplet loss method and then ploting the graph and also predicting the correct images

face_embidding_and_classification contain detecting and extracting the face of a given dataset using mtcnn, getting face embiddings and then doing the face classification

You need to install folowing libraries of python : mtcnn, keras and tensorflow
